# Vehicle-price-prediction-using-Linear-Regression
This project is to predict the used Vehicle price according to several parameters using linear Regression algorithum and I aiming to test my Linear rgression model assumption and sure it's satisfied.  

# Dataset:  
## Vehicle dataset: it is dataset for cars prices collected from websites  
This dataset contains information about used cars.  
This data can be used for a lot of purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of linear regression in Machine Learning.  
The columns in the given dataset are as follows:  
1-name  
2-year  
3-selling_price  
4-km_driven  
5-fuel  
6-seller_type  
7-transmission  
8-Owner
